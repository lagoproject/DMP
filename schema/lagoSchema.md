## What is defined?

This schema is the metadata vocabulary used to describe the datasets (the files) and catalogs (the directories) stored in LAGO repositories. The aim is to provide a stardandised description of the data to make them findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable [(FAIR)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). 

This specification is independent from the other metadata currently generated by LAGO applications. They should coexist to avoid significance loss, since legacy metadata files are handled as datatasets. 

Therefore, the metadata schema is based on three pillars:

- [The LAGO vocabulary](./lagoSchema.jsonld): described in this document. It is a re-profile of [DCAT-AP2](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/dcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe)(European Commision), extending the existent classes and adding properties needed for LAGO computation.

- Main vocabulary: [DCAT-AP2](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/dcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe)(European Commision), which is an specific profile of [DCAT2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/)( W3C), recommended for repositories, content aggregators or data consumers related to public sector (governement, rearcher centers, founded projects).

- Language syntax: [JSON-LD 1.1](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/)( W3C). It is the simplest standard for linking metadata. Promoted by Google, currently it is ousting more heavy and compless syntaxes such as RDF, Turtle, XML.  


## How to use this metadata vocabulary?

Firstly, any developer should familiarise with the specifications of [JSON-LD 1.1](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/), [DCAT2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) and [DCAT-AP2](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/dcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe).  In particular, you should only focus on JSON-LD to avoid confusing with other syntaxes as well as you should mind many JSON-LD examples (as the ones at [json-ld.org](https://json-ld.org/) or W3C are only using the Schema.org, not DCAT, as main vocabulary. In this sense, you can review the JSON-LD implementations for [wc3.org/DCAT2](https://www.w3.org/ns/dcat2.jsonld) and [GitHub/DCAT-AP2](https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/tree/master/releases).

Secondly, the developer can use [this document](./lagoSchema.md) and the [lagoSchema.jsonld](./lagoSchema.jsonld) as the reference for:
- interpreting the state of the stored data (curation, provenance) and their contents (a resume) to:
    - make searches and process the selected data, 
    - expose some data and harvest them;
- making available data by means to: 
    - describe legacy data (extracting metadata from existing files),
    - generate new data with metadata (specific LAGO wrappers execute the processing or [simulations](examples/sims/simulationExample));
- using the pre-stablished:
    - [LAGO sites](/defs/lagoSites) or [LAGO organisation](/defs/lagoOrganisation).
    - licenses and permissions;
- proposing extensions of the schema or definitions:
    - new or simulated LAGO sites,
    - etc.
