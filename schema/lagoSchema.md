## What is defined?

This schema is the metadata vocabulary used to describe the datasets (the files) and catalogs (the directories) stored in LAGO repositories. The aim is to provide a stardandised description of the data to make them findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable [(FAIR)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). 

This specification is independent from the other metadata currently generated by LAGO applications. They should coexist to avoid significance loss, since legacy metadata files are handled as datatasets. 

Therefore, the metadata schema is based on three pillars:

- [The LAGO vocabulary](./lagoSchema.jsonld): described in this document. It is a re-profile of [DCAT-AP2, European Commision](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/dcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe), extending the existent classes and adding properties needed for LAGO computation.

- Main vocabulary: [DCAT-AP2, European Commision](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/dcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe), which is an specific profile of [DCAT2, W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) recommended for repositories, content aggregators or data consumers related to public sector (governement, rearcher centers, founded projects).

- Language syntax: [JSON-LD 1.1, W3C](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/). It is the simplest standard for linking metadata. Promoted by Google, currently it is ousting more heavy and compless syntaxes such as RDF, Turtle, XML.
