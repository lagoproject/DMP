### Introduction to the Data Management Plan

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that outlines how data are to be handled both during a research project and after the project is completed. 
It is the essential reference to assure the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse [(FAIR)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) of digital assets, 
establishing the format of data and metadata, how they are generated, stored, and accessed, among other issues.  
Currently, DMPs are mandatory for data-science and e-science funded grants and indispensable for the sustainability of any long-term project.

DMPs are living documents that will be amended, improved and detailed along the project timeline. Therefore, DMPs should have a clear version number and include a
timetable for updates. The DMPs should have been defined according to the template of the [DMP Online tool](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/), 
but they could derive into structured documents, as long as maintaining their unity.
